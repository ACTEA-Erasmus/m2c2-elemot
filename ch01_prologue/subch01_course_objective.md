# Course objective

The aim of this course is to steer and control electrical machines in a better way.
So far we can only switch an electric motor on and off. A few traditional methods allow us to adjust the speed, but this is usually limited and is achieved at the expense of considerable energy losses.
A motor controller, also known as a motor drive, or frequency drive, initially feeds a variable output frequency to the electric motor resulting into a variable rotational speed.
Other properties can also be adjusted.
In these lab sessions we will learn how to set up and use a motor controller.

The number of possible settings is innumerable. Not every possible setting is explained here. However, we give you the logic of programming a motor drive. To understand and use all parameters we refer to the control user guide.
