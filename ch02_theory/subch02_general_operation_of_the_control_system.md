# General operation of the control system
## Principle of the motor controller
## Pulse Width Modulation
## V/f
## Different modes of operation
### Open loop with fixed V/f mode: standard use with a fixed boost
### Open loop with quadratic V/f mode: applied at large moments of inertia
### Open loop with vector mode: flux optimisation
### Rotor Flux Control (RFC-A)
